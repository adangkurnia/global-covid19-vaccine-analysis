# Defining the question
The aim of this analysis is to find the current situation of the Covid-19 vaccine across the world. Some of the important things to see are: 
- the number of people that have partially, fully and booster vaccinated, 
- the historical cumulative trend of vaccines, 
- and vaccinated people per hundred across the world.

# Collecting the data
Data is collected from this [link](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer) until Jan 4 2023 

# Cleaning the data
There is nothing to be done about data cleaning because everything is already valid.

# Analyzing the data
- There are 5511963715 people who have got the first vaccine. It is 69% of the population
- There are 5058452918 people who have got 2nd vaccine. It is 63% of the population
- There are 2681355226 people who have got booster vaccine. It is 34% of the population
